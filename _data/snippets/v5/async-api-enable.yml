Elide Standalone: |+2
  <br/>
  Update your implementation of [ElideStandaloneSettings](https://github.com/yahoo/elide/blob/master/elide-standalone/src/main/java/com/yahoo/elide/standalone/config/ElideStandaloneSettings.java) interface with the below mentioned additional code. (Only the relevant portions are included.)

  ```java
  /**
   * Enable the support for Async querying feature. If false, the async feature will be disabled.
   * @return Default: False
   */
  @Override
  public boolean enableAsync() {
      return true;
  }

  /**
   * Enable the support for cleaning up Async query history. If false, the async cleanup feature will be disabled.
   * @return Default: False
   */
  @Override
  public boolean enableAsyncCleanup() {
      return true;
  }
  ```

Elide Spring: |+2
  <br/>
  Update your application.yaml with below mentioned additional code.(Only the relevant portions are included.)

  If you rely on Spring to autodiscover the entities which are placed in the same package/sub-package as the application class with @SpringBootApplication annotation, you will have to add the @EntityScan annotation to that application class for those entities to be discovered after async is enabled.

  ```yaml
  elide:
    async:
      enabled: true
      cleanupEnabled: true
  ```
