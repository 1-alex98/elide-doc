## Overview

Elide APIs are designed for synchronous request and response behavior. The time allowed to service a synchronous response can be limited by proxy servers and gateways. Analytic queries can often take longer than these limits and result in a server timeout. Elide's asynchronous API decouples the submission of a request and the delivery of the response into separate client calls. Some of the features available are:
* Queries are run in a background thread that posts the results into a persistence store.
* Results can be retrieved as an embedded response or URL for downloading later (to be available soon).
* Supported downloading formats - CSV and JSON.
* Queries can be configured to execute synchronously before switching to asynchronous mode if not finished by a client provided threshold.
* Status for queries which were interrupted due to an application crash/reboot is also updated after restart.
* Queries and results stored in the database longer than a configurable threshold are deleted.

## Design
The Async API is built using standard Elide models (AsyncQuery and TableExport). The results of the requests submitted using AsyncQuery model will be embedded within the `result` property of the model. The TableExport requests provide a URL on successful completion that can be used to download results at a later time. TableExport should be preferred for larger results.

Async requests submitted with the QUEUED status and valid options are queued for execution. Each Elide instance runs a background scheduler process which is responsible for executing these requests in the background via threads and posting the results to the database. These requests can be configured to execute synchronously up to 10 seconds before switching to asynchronous mode. The requests not finished synchronously by the client provided threshold are handed off to a separate thread for posting the results once complete.

Each Elide instance also runs two separate background processes for maintenance and cleanup. The first process is responsible for cleaning up of requests and results stored in the database. It is also responsible for updating the status of requests which were interrupted due to application crash or reboot and are no longer executing. The second process is responsible for graceful cancellation of async requests. The user can at any time update the status of the async requests to CANCELLED. The background process polls the AsyncQuery and TableExport models to find any new requests that were CANCELLED and tries to terminate the database transaction associated with that execution and change the status to CANCEL_COMPLETE. The same process is also responsible for terminating transactions spawned by the async requests which have been executing longer than the configured max run time threshold. Once the transaction is terminated, the background thread executing the original request will be interrupted. The retention, polling interval and max run time thresholds can be configured during application startup.

For submitting of requests and retrieving the results, refer example [calls](/pages/guide/v{{ page.version }}/11.5-asyncapi.html#running).

### Supported Query Types

Below are the supported values for query type in asynchronous calls:

* GRAPHQL_V1_0
* JSONAPI_V1_0

### Supported Result Types

Below are the supported values for result type in asynchronous calls (Table Export only):

* JSON
* CSV

### Query Status

Below are the different possible statuses of asynchronous calls:

| Status          | Description                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| QUEUED          | Async request is submitted and waiting to be picked up for execution.                 |
| PROCESSING      | Async request has been picked up for execution.                                       |
| COMPLETE        | Async request has completed.                                                          |
| CANCELLED       | Async request status can be updated to CANCELLED by the users for a background process to perform the cancellation.|
| TIMEDOUT        | Async request did not finish within the configured maximum run time.                  |
| FAILURE         | Async request not completed due to failure encountered by the background process.     |
| CANCEL_COMPLETE | Async request has been cancelled by the background process.                           |
{:.table}

Malformed or invalid queries provided in the Async request will finish with COMPLETE status and the actual error message will be
available in the result property of AsyncQuery and TableExport models.

## Security

The Async API models (AsyncQuery and TableExport) have a simple permission model: Only the principal which submitted a query and principals which belong to an administrative role are allowed to retrieve its status or results. Principals can be assigned roles when constructing the Elide [user](/pages/guide/v{{ page.version }}/03-security.html#user) object.

## Enable the Async API

By default the async API is disabled. The elide models (AsyncQuery and TableExport) needed to support the Async API are JPA [models][demo-schema] that are mapped to a specific database schema. This schema must be created in your target database. Feel free to modify the query/result column sizes per your needs.

| Configuration       | Description                                                                                | Default  |
| ---------------     | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      | -------  |
| enabled             | Enable the Async API feature.                                                              | false    |
| cleanupEnabled      | Enable cleaning up of Async API requests history and update status of interrupted queries. | false    |
{:.table}

{% include code_example example="async-api-enable" %}

#### Additional Configuration

There are additional overrides which can be added to update the default configurations related to number of threads, query timeouts and query cleanups.

| Configuration                     | Description                                                             | Default  |
| ---------------                   | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------  |
| threadPoolSize                    | Number of Async requests to run in parallel.                            | 5        |
| maxRunTimeMinutes                 | Maximum query run time for Async requests before TIMEDOUT.              | 60       |
| queryCleanupDays                  | Number of days to retain async request executions and results history.  | 7        |
| queryCancellationIntervalSeconds  | A background process is responsible for cancelling the transactions for Async requests marked as CANCELLED and changing the status to CANCEL_COMPLETE. Polling interval to identify CANCELLED async requests and update status. | 300 |
{:.table}

## Running

Once you have configured the settings based on your preference, start the Elide service and run the following curl commands to submit calls to JSON-API/GraphQL endpoints be executed asynchronously. Donâ€™t forget to replace localhost:8080 with your URL. The example below makes use of the models and sample data that the liquibase migrations added through our example is [available here][elide-demo].

### Submitting query

{% include code_example example="async-api-submit" %}

Here are the respective repsonses:

{% include code_example example="async-api-submit-rsp" %}

### Retrieving status and result

{% include code_example example="async-api-status" %}

Here are the respective repsonses:

{% include code_example example="async-api-status-rsp" %}

## Overriding the AsyncQueryDAO

The Async API interacts with the persistence layer through an abstraction - the AsyncQueryDAO, for status updates, query cleanup, etc. This can be customized by providing your own implementation. Elide provides a default implementation of [AsyncQueryDAO][default-async-query-dao].

{% include code_example example="async-api-dao-disabled" %}

## Overriding the ResultStorageEngine

Table exports leverage a reactive abstraction (ResultStorageEngine) for streaming results to and from a persistence backend. This can be customized by proviing your own implementation. Elide provides default implementation of [ResultStorageEngine][file-result-storage-engine].

{% include code_example example="async-api-storageengine-disabled" %}
